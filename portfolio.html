<h1> Data Analysis Project:
<br>  <img src="images/analysis.png" height="300">
<br> We are tasked with finding out in what biome the rover is on an alien planet. Our rover provided us with a series of data collected by gyroscope, sound, temperature 
and light sensors. Next, I organized and created charts to visualize the data and determined which sensors the data came from. Finally, compare the collected data to the 
environment of an alien planet and believe the rover is located in a desert plain.
