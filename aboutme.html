<h1> Yasamin, Isooda, and Dorsa are my best friends since I can remember. They are in the photo on the right. That photo is from our Arizona trip in December, 2019. We love to travel together.
On the left is my close friend Mio who I met in middle school. Her and I both love to have Christmas spirit and wear pajamas.
